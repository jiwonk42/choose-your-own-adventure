  You try to shine the light on the shadow, but it moves quickly and you cannot follow it. The flashlight turns off. The shadow seems to detach from the wall and begins to move closer. Its footsteps click with each step. You back up against the wall and shake the flashlight. It flickers on and shines on the shadow. It seems to burn it and the shadow staggers back, but the flashlight turns off again. The shadow is quicker now. It rushes towards you as you struggle with the flashlight. Right before the shadow consumes you, the light flickers back on, exposing the shadow. It burns the shadow, igniting it, flashing what looks like your partner's face in its darkness. As the face disappears, the shadow melts away and scatters throughout the garage. Outside, you hear cicadas consume the silence.<br>

  <p>You have defeated the evil presence, for now.</p>
